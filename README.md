# CO2-ethane

Calculating physical properties of C2H6-CO2 binary mixture.

## Usage:

 - Install CoolProp for Python (www.coolprop.org) 
 - Make sure Python has connected with Matlab (www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/pyenv.html)
 - Two examples are given in the examples folder. 
 - For the details of the model development, please refer to [Hu (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0017931021006475).
